**Impact**: Fixed event handling throughout the self-development system

### 2. Application Healer Core Methods âœ…  
**Problem**: Missing critical methods: check_application_health, analyze_error, generate_health_report  
**Solution**: 
- Implemented `check_application_health()` with comprehensive system monitoring
- Added `analyze_error()` method to ErrorDetector with severity classification
- Created `generate_health_report()` method in HealthReporter with full diagnostics  
**Impact**: Complete application healing functionality now operational

### 3. Method Parameter Mismatches âœ…
**Problems**: 
- FixGenerator.generate_fix() called with incorrect keyword arguments
- RecoveryManager.create_recovery_plan() called with wrong parameters
- CodeGenerator.generate_code() missing required reasoning_data and requirements arguments

**Solutions**: Updated all test method calls to match correct signatures  
**Impact**: All component interactions now function properly

### 4. Missing Component Methods âœ…
**Problems**: Multiple components missing expected methods  
**Solutions**: 
- Added missing `generate_health_report()` to HealthReporter
- Fixed all EventType import references in self-development engine
- Resolved parameter mismatches across the system  

**Impact**: Complete API compatibility restored
